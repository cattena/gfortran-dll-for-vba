# gfortran-dll-for-vba
Fortran templates for creating DLLs (for VBA) using MinGW.

Unfortunately, one fortran project is required to provide an interface for Microsoft Excel. 

Using the excellent tools of MinGW, I'm suffering trying to create a DLL callable from VBA.

There are uncountable how-to's and examples on the web, but I couldn't find one that worked for me.

This tiny repo is intended to host working fortran templates for DLL creation.

WORK IN PROGRESS.
